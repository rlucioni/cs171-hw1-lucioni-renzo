1. We are provided the following code snippet: `d3.selectAll("tbody tr")[0].length-1`. The first part of the snippet, `selectAll("tbody tr")`, returns an array containing an array of all `tr` elements (i.e., rows) in `tbody`, the table body. The next part, `[0]`, indexes to the first and only entry in the array, returning the inner, nested array which actually contains the selected `tr` elements. Calling `length` on this array returns to us the number of rows in the table body, from which we subtract one. The end result is an integer one less than the number of rows in the table body.

2. The function `color` returns hexadecimal RGB strings corresponding to a range of colors between orange-red and silver. Calling `color(0)` returns `#ff4500`, the hex code for orange-red. Calling `color(10)` returns `#f25e26`, the hex code for a similar orange-red color with a hint of gray or silver. Calling `color(150)` returns `#42ffff`, the hex code for a cyan color.

3. If the array passed to `domain()` instead contained the minimum and maximum "Rate" values - in this case 2.6 to 9.0, respectively - the scale would be narrowed significantly. The scale would only map values between 2.6 and 9.0 to a hex color code between orange-red and silver, instead of doing so for values between 0 and 50; 50 is one less than the number rows in the body of our table. This would be appropriate if we were trying to visually encode the rate of unemployment in each state instead of the sorted position of each row.
