1. This bar chart is not usable in its current form. At a minimum, this bar chart needs a title, labels indicating which state each bar represents, and labels indicating the "Rate" value each bar represents. Adding the ability to sort the bars in the chart by their value would further increase the bar chart's usability.

2. The outermost `g` element contains all elements composing the bar chart, including the `text` element corresponding to the chart title, all `rect` elements corresponding to the chart bars, and all `text` elements corresponding to the chart labels. The intermediate, middle `g` element holds the groups containing all `rect` elements corresponding to the chart bars and all `text` elements corresponding to the chart labels. Each of the innermost `g` elements contains a `rect` element corresponding to a chart bar, a `text` element indicating the state the bar represents, and a second `text` element indicating the "Rate" value the bar represents.

3. Assuming that our `rect` elements are not transparent, the order in which the `text` elements are added matters. If the `text` elements are added before the `rect` elements, the `rect` elements will be layered over the `text` elements, obscuring them from view. If the `text` elements are added after the `rect` elements, the `text` elements will be layered over the `rect` elements, allowing them to be visible. So, we want to add the `text` elements after the `rect` elements. However, if our `rect` elements have some transparency, the order in which the `text` elements are added is not as important; the `text` elements will be visible even if the `rect` elements are layered over them.
